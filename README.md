## Kafka implementation
Sending message(bytes) and header of message type to kafka topic from service and then consumed same topic bytes and special headers with 
defining type of payload and converting to special 
object of this type 

(Commonly this payload type using for heartbeats sending and main object payload, but this 
project just example of usages of some technologies. Correctly using different publishers, different topics and 
different listeners for better application designing)
